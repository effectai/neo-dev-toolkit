* Effect Network NEO Implementation
  
  Start of the reference implementation of the Effect protocol in NEO.

** Getting started

   The project requires Docker to setup and connect all the pieces
   during development.

   Currently this repository sets up a private NEO blockchain and
   starts running a 4-node consensus. Each node keeps its own wallet
   in ~/opt/neo-cli/wallet.db3~ that will receive transaction fees
   from their blocks.

   To run the private chain:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker-compose up -d
   #+END_SRC
